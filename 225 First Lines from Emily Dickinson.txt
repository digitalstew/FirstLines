A little road not made of man,
A wounded deer leaps highest,
Alter? When the hills do.
Angels in the early morning
As children bid the guest good-night,
Belshazzar had a letter,
Delight becomes pictorial
Glee! The great storm is over!
Have you got a brook in your little heart,
I asked no other thing,
I had no time to hate, because
I have no life but this,
I know a place where summer strives
I taste a liquor never brewed,
If I can stop one heart from breaking,
If I should die, And you should live,
If you were coming in the fall,
Is Heaven a physician?
Much madness is divinest sense
New feet within my garden go,
On this long storm the rainbow rose,
One dignity delays for all,
Our share of night to bear,
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower?
Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
Safe in their alabaster chambers,
So bashful when I spied her,
The bee is not afraid of me,
The brain within its groove
The heart asks pleasure first,
The one that could repeat the summer day
The pedigree of honey
There's a certain slant of light,
To fight aloud is very brave,
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
Upon the gallows hung a wretch,
Whether my bark went down at sea,
Who robbed the woods, The trusting woods?
Your riches taught me poverty.
He ate and drank the precious words,
There is no frigate like a book
A charm invests a face
A Clock Stopped -- Not The Mantel's;
Ample make this bed.
I'll tell you how the sun rose,
A death-blow is a life-blow to some
A dew sufficed itself
A light exists in spring
Fate slew him, but he did not drop;
A modest lot, a fame petite,
A murmur in the trees to note,
A poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
A face devoid of love or grace,
I meant to have but modest needs,
A sepal, petal, and a thorn
Some keep the Sabbath going to church;
A shady friend for torrid days
A sickness of this world it most occasions
Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
Could mortal lip divine
An awful tempest mashed the air,
A thought went up my mind to-day
A throe upon the features
The wind begun to rock the grass
A toad can die of light!
A train went through a burial gate,
What mystery pervades a well!
A word is dead When it is said,
Adrift! A little boat adrift!
Afraid? Of whom am I afraid?
The murmuring of bees has ceased;
Within my reach! I could have touched!
When I was small, a woman died.
Our lives are Swiss, So still, so cool,
I'm wife; I've finished that,
Come slowly, Eden! Lips unused to thee,
An altered look about the hills;
As by the dead we love to sit,
As imperceptibly as grief
As far from pity as complaint,
We never know how high we are
Departed to the judgment,
At half-past three a single bird
The night was wide, and furnished scant
At least to pray is left, is left.
Her final summer was it,
Of bronze and blaze
The morns are meeker than they were,
The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
Before the ice is in the pools,
You left me, sweet, two legacies,
Bless God, he went as soldiers,
I started early, took my dog,
Just lost when I was saved!
All overgrown by cunning moss,
Softened by Time's consummate plush,
Of all the souls that stand create
The spider as an artist
Drab habitation of whom?
For each ecstatic instant
Proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,
A door just opened on a street
Could I but ride indefinite,
When night is almost done,
Not knowing when the dawn will come
The day came slow, till five o'clock,
There's something quieter than sleep
Apparently with no surprise
Death is a dialogue between
Death is like the insect
A deed knocks first at thought,
Who never wanted, -- maddest joy
It dropped so low in my regard
Let me not mar that perfect dream
Drowning is not so pitiful
The sun kept setting, setting still;
I heard a fly buzz when I died;
Each that we lose takes part of us;
No rack can torture me,
That is solemn we have ended,
God gave a loaf to every bird,
Step lightly on this narrow spot!
I never hear the word "escape"
Essential oils are wrung:
On this wondrous sea,
The cricket sang, And set the sun,
Except the heaven had come so near,
Except to heaven, she is nought;
The soul selects her own society,
I stepped from plank to plank
Experiment to me Is every one I meet.
Faith is a fine invention For gentlemen who see;
Far from love the Heavenly Father
Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,
Father, I bring thee not myself,
Few get enough, -- enough is one;
Ashes denote that fire was;
I had no cause to be awake,
Forbidden fruit a flavor has
Heaven is what I cannot reach!
There is a word Which bears a sword
Frequently the woods are pink,
Are friends delight or pain?
God made a little gentian;
My cocoon tightens, colors tease,
One need not be a chamber to be haunted,
Given in marriage unto thee,
Going to heaven! I don't know when,
On such a night, or such a night,
Went up a year this evening!
Good night! which put the candle out?
The leaves, like women, interchange
I measure every grief I meet
He put the belt around my life,
He touched me, so I live to know
Heart not so heavy as mine,
Heart, we will forget him!
High from the earth I heard a bird;
Hope is the thing with feathers
Hope is a subtle glutton;
How dare the robins sing,
How still the bells in steeples stand,
I had been hungry all the years;
I breathed enough to learn the trick,
I bring an unaccustomed wine
I died for beauty, but was scarce
I felt a funeral in my brain,
I found the phrase to every thought
I gained it so, By climbing slow,
I had a guinea golden;
I have a king who does not speak;
I have not told my garden yet,
I know that he exists
I lived on dread; to those who know
I many times thought peace had come,
I meant to find her when I came;
I never lost as much but twice,
I never saw a moor,
I noticed people disappeared,
I read my sentence steadily,
I reason, earth is short,
I shall know why, when time is over,
I think just how my shape will rise
I went to heaven, 'T was a small town,
I went to thank her,
I wish I knew that woman's name,
I wonder if the sepulchre
I worked for chaff, and earning wheat
I'm Nobody! Who are you?
I've got an arrow here;
I've seen a dying eye
If anybody's friend be dead,
If I may have it when it's dead
If I should n't Be Alive
If the foolish call them 'flowers,'
Immortal is an ample word
It is an honorable thought,
A precious, mouldering pleasure 't is
In lands I never saw, they say,
I dreaded that first robin so,
A bird came down the walk:
I CANNOT live with you,
These are the days when birds come back,
From us she wandered now a year,
Is bliss, then, such abyss
It can't be summer, -- that got through;
It was not death, for I stood up,
It was too late for man,
It'S All I Have To Bring To-Day,
If tolling bell I ask the cause.
Lay this laurel on the one
Let down the bars, O Death!
It's such a little thing to weep,
Life, and Death, and Giants
Like mighty footlights burned the red
I envy seas whereon he rides,
Look back on time with kindly eyes,
To lose one's faith surpasses
I had a daily bliss I half indifferent viewed,
I lost a world the other day.
I'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs;
My worthiness is all my doubt,
Love is anterior to life,
Split the lark and you'll find the music,
We like March, his shoes are purple,
